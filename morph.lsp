;;;  perfectly into the given duration (no subtraction of last rhythm)

;;;  is happening. Can be a list (eg. one made from fibonacci-transitions).
;;;  Can also be a function, which must accept one rational number as an
;;;  argument and returns one rational number.
;;; length - when nil, generate a list with duration, when a number, generate
